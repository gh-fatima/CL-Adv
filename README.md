Contrastive learning algorithms attempt to extract some effective representations such
that similar samples stay close to each other, while dissimilar ones are far apart. 
SimCLR algorithm is a simple framework for contrastive learning shown a
good performance without having any labels. The main idea of this project is 
to investigate the robustness of the representations extracted by SimCLR algorithm.
